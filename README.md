# Learning Graphl by doing :

## The shell

* Create an index.js file
* `npm init`
* `npm i graphql-yoga`

## Setup our structure

We're going to use graphql-yoga to help us with our structure.  It looks something like this :

```
//Graphql-yoga is like express for graphql.  It takes in the required setup and then 
//routes requests to where they need to go
const { GraphQLServer } = require('graphql-yoga')

const typeDefs = `

`

const resolvers = {
    
}

//Our server is looking for our typeDefs and our Resolvers
const server = new GraphQLServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
})
server.start(() => console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:4000`))
```

## Our first working datapoint

Let's add a query and an resolver to...resolve it.

```diff
//Types are what makes graphql stand out over REST.  
//We need to define every piece of data we're going to use
const typeDefs = `
+type Query {
+  welcome: String!
+}
`

+//This object needs to match the structure of our typeDefinition
+//All values should be functions and what they return is like doing a res.send
+const resolvers = {
+    Query: {
+        welcome: () => `Hacker News clone begins.`,
+    }
+}

```

Run your server (index.js is a node file)


## Non-basic data

We'll rarely have an endpoint that returns a basic string.  Let's return and array of objects.

```diff
//Graphql-yoga is like express for graphql.  It takes in the required setup and then 
//Routes requests to where they need to go
const { GraphQLServer } = require('graphql-yoga')

+//Types are what makes graphql stand out over REST.  
+//We need to define every piece of data we're going to use
+//The structure of a Type :
+/*
+    type NAME - This declares a type and names it, just like a class
+        Then inside the type we declare our properties
+    ! - Required
+    [] = Array
+*/
const typeDefs = `
type Query {
  welcome: String!
+  links: [Link!]!
}

+type Link {
+  id: ID!
+  description: String!
+  url: String!
+}
`

+//This is just some dummy data.  In a real app we'd use a database instead
+let articleLinks = [{
+    id: 'link-0',
+    url: 'www.howtographql.com',
+    description: 'A resources to learn graphql. Check out the advanced sections for some more in-depth tutorials.'
+}, {
+    id: 'link-1',
+    url: 'news.ycombinator.com',
+    description: 'Hacker news is like reddit that doesn\'t suck.  Focused on tech.  Great place to improvey our chameleon skills.'
+}, {
+    id: 'link-2',
+    url: 'https://www.graphqlhub.com/',
+    description: 'Some practice APIs to play around with queries'
+}]

+//This object needs to match the structure of our typeDefinition Queries and Mutations
+//All values should be functions and what they return is like doing a res.send...almost
const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        welcome: () => `Hacker News clone begins.`,
+        links: () => articleLinks,
    }
}

//Our server is looking for our typeDefs and our Resolvers
const server = new GraphQLServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
})
server.start(() => console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:4000`))

```

## Adding new links

Great, now we can get data, let's learn how to modify our data.  We'll do that by adding new articles to our list

```diff
//Graphql-yoga is like express for graphql.  It takes in the required setup and then 
//Routes requests to where they need to go
const { GraphQLServer } = require('graphql-yoga')

//Types are what makes graphql stand out over REST.  
//We need to define every piece of data we're going to use
//The structure of a Type :
/*
    type NAME - This declares a type and names it, just like a class
        Then inside the type we declare our properties
    ! - Required
    [] = Array
*/
//Naming matters : Query and Mutation are reserved types.  These will be turned into
//The parts of our API we can interact with
const typeDefs = `
type Query {
  welcome: String!
  links: [Link!]!
}

+type Mutation {
+  addLink(url: String!, description: String!): Link!
+}

type Link {
  id: ID!
  description: String!
  url: String!
}
`

//This is just some dummy data.  In a real app we'd use a database instead
let articleLinks = [{
    id: 'link-0',
    url: 'www.howtographql.com',
    description: 'A resources to learn graphql. Check out the advanced sections for some more in-depth tutorials.'
}, {
    id: 'link-1',
    url: 'news.ycombinator.com',
    description: 'Hacker news is like reddit that doesn\'t suck.  Focused on tech.  Great place to improvey our chameleon skills.'
}, {
    id: 'link-2',
    url: 'https://www.graphqlhub.com/',
    description: 'Some practice APIs to play around with queries'
}]
+let idCount = articleLinks.length

//This object needs to match the structure of our typeDefinition Queries and Mutations
//All values should be functions and what they return is like doing a res.send...almost
const resolvers = {
    Query: {
        welcome: () => `Hacker News clone begins.`,
        links: () => articleLinks,
    },
+    Mutation: {
+        addLink: (root, args) => { //root is for context, args is for params coming in
+            const link = {
+                id: `link-${idCount++}`,
+                description: args.description,
+                url: args.url,
+            }
+            articleLinks.push(link)
+            return link //like res.send
+        }
+    },
}

//Our server is looking for our typeDefs and our Resolvers
const server = new GraphQLServer({
    typeDefs,
    resolvers,
})
server.start(() => console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:4000`))
```
